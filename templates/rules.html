        1. Intro
    </h3>
    This page outlines the rules for playing HCTCG, this rulebook is written assuming you are playing within minecraft, but <br>
    notes will be added for players playing with the physical version of HCTCG.<br>
    HCTCG is very similar to the Pokemon Trading Card Game, experience in that game will help, but not required, as <br>
    this game is very easy to learn.

    <h3 id="setup">
        2. Set up
    </h3>
    To set up the game, start by having both players place their decks (out of the bundle) into the white shulkers <br>
    for their corresponding sides, located in the middle of the floor. <br>
    Then, make sure both the hand shulker (cyan) and Discard shulker (red) are empty, along with no cards on the board. <br>
    On Wildcard MC, A Referee is needed in order to gain tokens from the match, the referee will handle things such as health, <br>
    pressing buttons in the arena, and clarifying rules, ensure that you have one to referee the match, especially <br>
    for your first game.

        4. The Cards
    </h3>
    There are 3 types of cards in HCTCG:
    <h4>
        Hermit Cards:
    </h4>
    Hermit cards are the baseline of HCTCG, they are the cards that are used in attacking/being attacked by your opponent.
    a Hermit card has a Name, Art, Heath, 2 attacks with relevant damage and item costs, and a type.
    hermit cards come in 3 different rarities: <br>
    <i>Common hermits</i> have basic attacks, and are generally weak. <br>
    <i>Rare hermits</i> have an attack (typically the 2nd) with a special effect on it, each effect is unique to the Hermit, and you can see it via hovering over the item in the inventory.<br>
    <i>Ultra Rare Hermits</i> are very similar to rares, currently, 3 exist, UR Etho, UR Beef, UR TFC (On wildcard or the IRL tcg, these cards do not exist) these cards were made specially for people for a few reasons. <br>

    <h4>
        Item Cards:
    </h4>
    Item cards are attached to a Hermit in order to "power up" it's attacks, to use an attack, the relevant "cost" (designated by the symbols to the left of the attack's name) must be met, for example, Common Bdub's "Gradient" Requires 1 Builder type item card attached to it. there are 10 different item cards, one for each type, and the right type is required to "power" an attack. <br>
    A white circle in an attack cost indicated that any type item card may be used to fufill that part of the cost. <br>
    Example: Rare Bdub's "Shreep" Requires 2 Builder item cards, and 1 of any item card attached to it, this is useful for decks that may use two or more types of hermit.
